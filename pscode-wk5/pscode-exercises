// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers


Begin
Input variables a, b, and sum where a=1, b=2, and sum =a+b
Display 'The sum of given two numbers is:' sum
End

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Begin
Input a variable number = 0
Display/ Print 'Enter a number:'
Read number
If number %2==0 Then output: "even"
Else output: "odd"
End


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Begin
Input n1, n2, n3, n4, n5
Avg =(n1+n2+n3+m4+n5)/5
If(n1 < n2) Set max to n2 Else Set max to n1
 If(n3 > max) Set max to n3 
If(n4 > max) Set max to n4 
If(n5 > max) Set max to n5 
Display "The max is:" 
If(n1 > n2) Set min to n2 Else Set min to n1
If(n3 < min) Set min to n3 
If(n4 < min) Set min to n4 
If(n5 < min) Set min to n5 
Display "The min is:"
